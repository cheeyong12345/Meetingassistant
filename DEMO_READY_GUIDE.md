# Select specific device in config.yaml
audio:
    input_device: 0  # Try different numbers
```

### Models Not Loading?
```bash
# Check model files exist
ls -lh models/

# Re-download if needed
python3 install_sbc.py
```

### Web Server Won't Start?

export MEETING_ASSISTANT_PORT=8080
python3 web_app.py
```

            model_size: "base"  # Fast enough for demo

summarization:
    default_engine: "qwen3"
    engines:
        qwen3:
            model_name: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"  # Faster model

processing:
    real_time_stt: true
